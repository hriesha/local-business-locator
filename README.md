# INFO 340 Project Proposal

# Problem/Data Domain

1. Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").

How can we find and support local, family-owned, and/or minority-owned businesses? Local, family-owned, and minority owned businesses play a vital role in building diverse, sustainable communities. However, many of these businesses struggle to gain customer support in an economy dominated by large corporations and hot trends. 

2. Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").

What are the main reasons why local, family-owned, and minority-owned businesses can’t stay in business for a prolonged period of time compared to large businesses? Something that may help could be a consulting app that provides a process for studying successful companies and integrating some of their strategies into a local, smaller business to prolong its success and profits.

3. Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")

talkdesk.com - ‘Built for small businesses under 50 employees to serve customers like big brands—without the cost or complexity.’ ‘With Talkdesk Express™, you get AI-powered customer service tools in one easy-to-use platform—so you can launch quickly, serve your customers better, and grow confidently, just like the big brands.’ 

In short: let us know what you are interested in, and identify a problem that you think needs solving (and that might be amenable to a technological intervention) while also considering what has come before. (While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with?)

The problem statement is that minority, local, and/or family businesses lack the support and visibility of a larger, diverse population that will propel the business forward. Facing this issue requires substantial efforts beyond the existing Yelp or Google Maps insights, which are places where users can find information on local organizations/businesses. Maps provide listings but don’t actively promote or prioritize small and minority-owned businesses, making it difficult to attract new customers and find places where consumers can intentionally go and support these locally owned firms.
The majority of existing technologies tailor and provide advice on the customer service aspect of the business, not generating new diverse populations and outreach that is most crucial for a smaller, growing business. Having more equitable economic opportunities, similar to how more established, non-minority, long-lasting businesses exist, will also advance economic prosperity on a larger scale. In order to meet these issues, there needs to be a form of technology that engages customers, meets cultural needs, and promotes inclusivity in the business community.	

# App Description

1. Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?

The users of the app are people who want to discover and support local, family-owned, and minority-owned businesses, as well as the business owners themselves. Customers can search for shops and learn their stories, while business owners can create or update profiles to share information about their services, hours, and contact details. The app helps minority groups by giving them more visibility and opportunities to reach supportive customers.

2. What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that your app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are!

- Search and Filter Businesses (Feature 1): Users can search by category, location, or owner type  (women-owned, minority-owned).
- Business Profile Management (Feature 2): Business owners can create or edit profiles, add descriptions, upload photos, and update their information.
- Favorites or Reviews (Half Feature): Users can mark businesses as favorites or leave reviews to recommend them to others.

3. What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.

The user will display detailed business information such as name, category, ownership type, story, contact details, and multimedia such as shop photos. Our goal is to consolidate this information into one accessible, user-friendly hub to address the lack of visibility that small businesses face. 

4. How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?

The app connects customers directly with small and minority-owned businesses, boosting their visibility and customer reach. By centralizing this information and making it easier to find, the app helps increase sales, strengthens local economies, and promotes inclusivity in business support. It encourages customers to “shop by their values” while empowering entrepreneurs to share their story. In doing so, the community can be more diverse, more culturally aware while also circulating wealth locally.
