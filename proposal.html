    <h1>INFO 340 Project Proposal: Supporting Local, Family-Owned, and Minority-Owned Businesses</h1>
  </header>
</body>

<main>

  <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
  <p>
    Local, family-owned, and minority owned businesses play a vital role in building diverse, sustainable communities. However, many of these businesses struggle to gain customer support in an economy dominated by large corporations and hot trends.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Technology Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Many small businesses lack the access to technology and visibility tools that helps them compete with larger companies. While larger companies have the resources for marketing, smaller businesses often rely on word of mouth and basic listings on <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google Search</a> - which neither promote these organizations actively.
  </p>

  <h3>Previous Solution</h3>
  <p>
    talkdesk.com - ‘Built for small businesses under 50 employees to serve customers like big brands—without the cost or complexity.’ ‘With Talkdesk Express™, you get AI-powered customer service tools in one easy-to-use platform—so you can launch quickly, serve your customers better, and grow confidently, just like the big brands.’
  </p>

  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>
    Minority, local, and/or family businesses lack the support and visibility of a larger, diverse population that will propel the business forward. Facing this issue requires substantial efforts beyond the existing Yelp or Google Maps insights, which are places where users can find information on local organizations/businesses. Maps provide listings but don’t actively promote or prioritize small and minority-owned businesses, making it difficult to attract new customers and find places where consumers can intentionally go and support these locally owned firms. The majority of existing technologies tailor and provide advice on the customer service aspect of the business, not generating new diverse populations and outreach that is most crucial for a smaller, growing business. Having more equitable economic opportunities, similar to how more established, non-minority, long-lasting businesses exist, will also advance economic prosperity on a larger scale. In order to meet these issues, there needs to be a form of technology that engages customers, meets cultural needs, and promotes inclusivity in the business community.
